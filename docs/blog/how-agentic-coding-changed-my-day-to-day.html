        <p>raw ideas. - agents as a paid intern. - prototyping wild
        ideas, is way more easy - finding things, super power - journey
        of Being a good specifier from a good coder - testing and trying
        out multiple approaches which wasn’t possible earlier. - more
        time to think and do what is more meaningfull. - fear of
        becoming obsolate, i don’t belive it but still scares me
        sometimes. - workflows, claude files, rules (may be a separate
        write up) - tooling in hand, and my preferences.(may be a
        separate write up) - context7, brguru Just occurred to me that I
        have not written a single line of code in past weeks. The agents
        are working for me, on the other side I’m spending most of my
        time reviewing the code. After all, I’m responsible for the code
        generated by these agents.</p>
        <p>Increased peer’s code, hence more revieweing.</p>
        <p>Getting time to read best practices, trends in the market,
        eventually this shapes revieweing and also help build good guard
        rails.</p>
        <p>We have seen this happening accross the organisation, also I
        see it has become an industry trend as well.</p>
