        love with the unfamiliar codebase</h1>
        <h3 id="guide-to-help-developers-code-contributors-to-get-familiar-with-unfamiliar-code">Guide
        to help developers/ code contributors to get familiar with
        unfamiliar code</h3>
        <p><img src="../images/getting-in-love-with-the-unfamiliar-codebase.avif" /></p>
        <p>There are many situations a developer or a code contributor
        comes across a new code base, be it a rise in attrition rate
        (post-pandemic) or a modern multi-tech stack combination
        requiring individuals to work on multiple code bases from time
        to time. This triggers a lack of confidence in taking tasks
        related to the new codebase (alienation üëΩ effect).</p>
        <p>Here I have tried to list some guided steps one can take to
        get familiar with any new codebase they come across.</p>
        <h3 id="understanding-the-background-businessdomain.">Understanding
        the background business/domain.</h3>
        <p>Leave the code aside, and understand the company‚Äôs or
        product‚Äôs core. - Having a clear picture of the problem, that a
        codebase is solving will help in a significant way in creating
        the mind map around the code structure and flow. - No need of
        getting into minute details, just a big-picture overview would
        be fine.</p>
        <h3 id="take-a-tour---as-an-end-user.">Take a tour - as an end
        user.</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>End-users, know the product better than any other
        stakeholder.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>Using the product, be it a website, a mobile app, or even an
        API solution gives you a clear knowledge of the product.</li>
        <li>Empowers you to break down the product into logical
        modules.</li>
        <li>Observe flow describers like -<br />
        </li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Menu(s) Items</li>
        <li>Heading/ Page titles</li>
        <li>Navigation bars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will help you to create an imaginary flow in your mind,
        hence the tour.</p>
        <h3 id="reading-the-documentation-available.">Reading the
        documentation available.</h3>
        <p>Documentation is primarily divided into high-level ( i.e
        Architecture and technical documentation) and low-level
        documentation ( i.e folder structure, naming conventions, and
        coding standards being used by the team).</p>
        <p>Also, this will help you to clear a lot of doubts that may
        arise when you actually explore the code or have a code
        walkthrough.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Draw a visual representation of the system with your
        understanding, and get it validated by someone who is already
        familiar with the code.</li>
        <li>Helps you understand the business use case and
        architecture.</li>
        <li>Make you aware of the tech stack used.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="setting-up-the-project-on-local">Setting up the project
        on local</h3>
        <p>Setting up a project will naturally force you to read the
        documentation.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Make sure, the APIs are working fine.</li>
        <li>In turn, you will get to know about external
        dependencies.</li>
        <li>Will help you to use IDE‚Äôs features to explore the code
        faster.</li>
        <li>Setting up, and using debugging to understand the flow will
        be really helpful.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="going-through-unit-tests">Going through unit tests</h3>
        <p>A properly written unit test/ automation script can elaborate
        on how the code works, and what to expect from
        modules/functions.</p>
        <p>Not only this, but also one can start diving into actual code
        through the unit tests, to understand how the particular part of
        code works and produce the expected results for the test
        case(s).</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Next step or the other way around could be to find a bug or
        the case that is not covered in test suits already written.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="looking-at-the-pull-requests">Looking at the Pull
        requests</h3>
        <p>PR(s) give you an idea of the current work being done, and
        what to expect in your upcoming tasks.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Take note of the feature requests and changes made as part
        of the development.</li>
        <li>Gives you an idea of code standards being used, eg: using
        <strong>CAPITAL</strong> case for constants. This will enable
        you to write better and expected code in the future.</li>
        <li>Try to re-write the code after reading someone‚Äôs PR. You‚Äôll
        see yourself more confident when actually working on your
        tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="spending-time-with-code">Spending time with code</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Love, at first sight!</strong> doesn‚Äôt work with
        <strong>code</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One needs to know the code and spend serious time to be in a
        relationship with the codebase. - Little extra time to study the
        code will help you build a mental map of how things are arranged
        and how to proceed to the solution of any given problem. -
        Document, and make notes of your understanding over time. -
        Focusing on small things at a time - Pick smaller bugs/tasks to
        think of solutions and try to solve them on your own.</p>
        <h3 id="peer-validation">Peer validation</h3>
        <p>Have validation of your understanding from existing team
        members. - Convince for reverse KT sessions in addition to KT
        sessions. - Indulge in pair programming if the other person
        agrees to it.</p>
        <p>It was all! I hope this will this would add some value to
        your journey of getting familiar with the new code base.</p>
        <p>Happy coding! üßë‚Äçüíª</p>
