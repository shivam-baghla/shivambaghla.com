raw ideas.
- agents as a paid intern.
- prototyping wild ideas, is way more easy
- finding things, super power
- journey of Being a good specifier from a good coder
- testing and trying out multiple approaches which wasn't possible earlier.
- more time to think and do what is more meaningfull.
- fear of becoming obsolate, i don't belive it but still scares me sometimes.
- workflows, claude files, rules (may be a separate write up)
- tooling in hand, and my preferences.(may be a separate write up)
    - context7, brguru
Just occurred to me that I have not written a single line of code in past weeks. The agents are working for me, on the other side I'm spending most of my time reviewing the code. After all, I'm responsible for the code generated by these agents. 

Increased peer's code, hence more revieweing.

Getting time to read best practices, trends in the market, eventually this shapes revieweing and also help build good guard rails.

We have seen this happening accross the organisation, also I see it has become an industry trend as well.
